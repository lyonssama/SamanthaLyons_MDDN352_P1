			<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif">Diving is a popular hobby in New Zealand as our country's coastline consists of many areas suitable for diving, whether it's freediving or scuba to explore our ocean. Diving can be a dangerous hobby as many run into problems in the water and unfortunately there have been 39 diver deaths between December 2006 and March 2016 (Police National Dive Squad). There are several factors that may contribute to divers running into problems however one that may help eliminate the risk of more close calls or even deaths is checking water conditions before diving, even if it is a beautiful day and condition look great.
			I am proposing a website/mobile application that provides divers with water conditions for their favourite diving locations, gives safety reminders and notifys them with suitable locations for diving depending on conditions.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif">After looking at what MetService currently provides divers, I discovered that it is quite complicated to work out what locations are suitable for diving, especially for beginners who don't understand tides/ideal diving conditions from a forecast. As seen in the screenshots of MetServices mobile application, they provide tides, winds and a brief visibity statement. marineweather.co.nz provides a pretty decent marine forecast as it shows swell, wave height, winds and tides based on the selected location which is what I would like to implement in my mobile application.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif">In order to really find out what the diving community would benefit from and want in a diving app, I got hold of Sam Wild, The NZ Spearo Forum admin where there is a community of approximately 10,000 divers. I asked these divers how they currently check diving conditions, whether a mobile application tht provided conditions for their favourite spots appeal to them and what features would be useful in this application. 

		From here I got some really helpful feedback and suggestions for what would be most helpful in an application. One of the most significant features that divers said would be helpful was to display the weather conditions for three days prior due to the fact that visibility is affected by wind and swell. 

		Other than wind, tides and swell being includes in the mobile application, there were some other interesting suggestions that would be helpful to divers such as webcams or satelite images overlooking the water so they can see what the weather is like at that location live. Another feature that would be more achievable would be a social platform where divers can log trips so that others can hear their experiences with the conditions.</font></p>
